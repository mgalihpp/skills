# Setup pstack — universal (Cursor / opencode / oh-my-pi / Claude Code)

Write harness-specific model-config rules. The skills read them and fall back to inline defaults when absent, so this is an override layer, not a requirement. Detect which harness is active and write to its canonical path; optionally mirror to the other harnesses so the config roams.

Canonical paths:
- **Cursor:** `~/.cursor/rules/pstack-models.mdc` (`alwaysApply: true`)
- **opencode:** `~/.config/opencode/rules/pstack-models.mdc` and `~/.config/opencode/pstack-models.json` (also supports project-local `.opencode/rules/pstack-models.mdc` or `opencode.json` `pstack` key)
- **oh-my-pi (omp):** `~/.config/omp/rules/pstack-models.mdc` and `~/.omp/rules/pstack-models.mdc` (also supports project-local `.agents/rules/pstack-models.mdc` or `.omp/rules/pstack-models.mdc`)
- **Claude Code / universal:** `~/.agents/rules/pstack-models.mdc` and `~/.claude/rules/pstack-models.mdc` (also supports project-local `.agents/rules/pstack-models.mdc`)

### 1. Detect available models

Enumerate the model slugs you can pass to a `Task` subagent in this session; that is the dependable source. If Cursor also exposes a models API or CLI that lists the user's entitled models, prefer it for completeness. If you cannot detect any, ask the user to paste the slugs they have access to. Never write a real slug you have not confirmed is available. The aliases `inherit-parent` and `auto` are always valid even though they are not detected slugs.

### 2. Load current state

The default role-to-model mapping is the rule shape shown in step 5 below. If `~/.cursor/rules/pstack-models.mdc` already exists, read it and treat its values as the current choices. Otherwise start from those defaults.

### 3. Map and confirm

Show every role with its current model, marking any real slug not in the detected set as needing a choice. Ask whether to accept as-is or change specific roles, offering the detected models plus `inherit-parent` and `auto` (both mean: this role runs on the parent chat model, which is how Auto users stay on Auto) as the options. Prefer AskQuestion over free text. For panel roles (how critics, arena runners, architect runners, interrogate reviewers) the value is a list, and one subagent runs per entry, alias entries included, so the list length sets the count. `arena cross-judge pool` is also a list, but Arena selects one value from it whose model family differs from the parent's when possible. `swarm workers` is the default model for every worker unless a race or comparison assigns another model per arm.

### 4. Validate

Every real slug written must be in the detected set; `inherit-parent` and `auto` always pass. If a chosen real slug is not available, stop and ask again. A rule pointing at a model the user cannot use breaks every delegation that reads it.

### 5. Write the rule

Detect active harness: check for `~/.cursor`, `~/.config/opencode`, `~/.config/omp`, `~/.omp`, `~/.claude`, `~/.agents` and the `opencode`/`omp` binaries on PATH. Write to the active harness's canonical path, then mirror to the other paths so the config roams across harnesses. At minimum always write:

1. **Active harness path** (e.g. Cursor → `~/.cursor/rules/pstack-models.mdc`, opencode → `~/.config/opencode/rules/pstack-models.mdc`, omp → `~/.config/omp/rules/pstack-models.mdc` or `~/.omp/rules/pstack-models.mdc`, Claude → `~/.claude/rules/pstack-models.mdc`)
2. **Universal mirror** `~/.agents/rules/pstack-models.mdc` (read by every harness via the `agents` provider) and project-local `.agents/rules/pstack-models.mdc` if the project uses `.agents/skills`

Each file gets `alwaysApply: true` frontmatter and one line per role, using the same labels poteto-mode uses. Overwrite whole files so re-runs stay idempotent. For opencode, also update `opencode.json` if present to ensure `permission.skill.*` allows pstack skills. Shape:

```

description: pstack per-role model choices (overrides skill defaults)
alwaysApply: true
---
# pstack model configuration. One line per role. Delete a line to fall back to the skill default.
# `inherit-parent` or `auto` as a value: the role runs on the parent chat model (omit Task `model`). Alias entries in a panel list still count toward its fan-out.

If the user runs `--global` or wants portable config, write project-local `.agents/rules/pstack-models.mdc` in the current repo instead of (or in addition to) the home-dir files.
### 6. Confirm

Tell the user the rule was written and that it applies to new sessions. Re-running this skill updates it.

### 7. Offer a verification skill (optional)

Check whether the project has a way to drive the real app for proof (a `verify-*` skill, or an existing harness). If not, offer once: "want a project-local verification skill, so agents can drive the app the way a user does and prove changes work? I can generate one with /create-verification-skill." On yes, invoke `/create-verification-skill` (resolves wherever pstack is installed — workspace, user, or plugin). On no, move on without pushing.
